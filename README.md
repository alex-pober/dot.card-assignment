## Dot.Card Assignment

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

Make sure you are running the latest node for NextJS - 13

Plz Note: Styled-components do not work well with NextJS 13 so styling structure is very janky.

## Getting Started

To run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
